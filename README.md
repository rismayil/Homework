# Homework Assignment

This is Maven based TestNG Homework Assignement project based on Page Object model.re

## Overview

This project does some filters while doing car search and verifies all filters.
It additionally does some actions such as select radio buttons, select options, taking screenshot etc.

## Features

Here are the packages that I created in this project

-base

-pages

-tests

-utils

In the base package I created BasePage and BaseTest classes to add some common functions that will be used by other classes such as invokeBrowser,waitForPageLoad,OpenApplication,getTitle,takeScreenShotOnFailure etc.
In the pages package I created object classes to represent pages that I used. You can find objects as well as the methods to do some actions which is specific for that particular page.
In the test package I created a single test class to run all tests
In the utils package I created some useful methods that will be used in other classes in order to avoid code duplications such as selectDropdown,waitForVisibility,scrollDownToElement,takeAScreenshot etc.
